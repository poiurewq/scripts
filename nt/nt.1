.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility initializes and edits documents, ideal for building an indexed list of notes documents.
.Pp
By default, the file extension for each new document is the extension of the last numbered document in the folder.
If the folder has no numbered documents,
.Nm
defaults to
.Pa .txt .
If the folder has a template file
.Ql nt_template. Ns Ar extension ,
then each new document uses this template's content and
.Ar extension .
.Pp
If
.Nm
is given a
.Ar title
when creating or renaming a doc, a number of underscores will be inserted between the numeric index and the title portion of the file name based on the same format as the last doc, defaulting to one underscore.
.Pp
As syntactic sugar, you can pass in multiple numeric indices, as well as
.Cm R
and/or
.Cm t
in a row to open the specified files all at once.
.Pp
Options include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h | Cm h
Print help page.
.It Cm n Op Ar title
Create a new document named with the highest unused numeric index (0-padded to 3 digits) followed by an underscore and a hyphenated version of the
.Ar title ,
with the same extension as the previous document (or .txt), then open it in the preferred editor.
If the current directory contains the file
.Ql nt_template. Ns Ar extension ,
then the new document uses this template's content and
.Ar extension
instead.
.It Cm l Op Ar title | Cm n
Open the document with the latest numeric index.
A numeric index must be a 1-to-3-digit positive integer.
If
.Ar title
is provided, rename this document to
.Ar title
without opening the document.
Alternatively, if the optional argument is
.Cm n ,
.Nm
simply returns the numeric index of the last detected note in the current directory.
.It Ar num Op Ar ...
Open the existing document(s) with the
.Ar num
index (indices).
.It Cm r Ar num Ar title
Rename the existing document with the
.Ar num
index to
.Ar title
without opening the document.
.It Cm rn Ar n Ar m
Starting from document index
.Ar n ,
renumber the consecutive run of documents so that
.Ar n
becomes
.Ar m ,
.Ar n Ns +1
becomes
.Ar m Ns +1 ,
and so on, until the end of the consecutive sequence.
Documents are renamed in the correct order to avoid collisions.
Fails if any target index is already occupied by a document outside the source range.
.It Cm a | Cm ar
Show an activity summary of indexed documents grouped by last-modified month.
.Cm a
searches the current directory only;
.Cm ar
searches all subdirectories as well.
.It Cm e Ar editor
Set the
.Ar editor
that
.Nm
will use for the current session.
The
.Ar editor
can be a command-line command or an application.
If
.Ar editor
name contains multiple words, single-quote the name.
In effect, this option sets the
.Ev NT_EDITOR
environment variable.
The default editor is vim.
This option must be called by sourcing rather than executing the
.Nm
script, as follows:
.Pp
.Dl $ source nt e Ar editor
.It Cm R
Open the README.md (case-insensitive) document in the current working directory, if there is any.
.It Cm t
Open the
.Pa nt_template
document in the current working directory, if there is any.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
